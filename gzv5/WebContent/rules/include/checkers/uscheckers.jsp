• American Checkers (a.k.a. English Checkers or simply Checkers) is played by two players. Each player begins the game with 12
colored discs. (Typically, one set of pieces is black and the other
red.)
<br>
<br>
• The board consists of 64 squares, alternating between 32 dark and 32
light squares. It is positioned so that each player has a light square
on the right side corner closest to him or her.
<br>
<br>
• Each player places his or her pieces on the 12 dark squares closest to
him or her.
<br>
<br>
• White moves first. Players then alternate moves.
<br>
<br>
• Moves are allowed only on the dark squares, so pieces always move
diagonally. Single pieces are always limited to forward moves (toward
the opponent).
<br>
<br>
• A piece making a non-capturing move (not involving a jump) may move
only one square.
<br>
<br>
• A piece making a capturing move (a jump) leaps over one of the
opponent's pieces, landing in a straight diagonal line on the other
side. Only one piece may be captured in a single jump; however, multiple
jumps are allowed on a single turn.
<br>
<br>
• When a piece is captured, it is removed from the board.
<br>
<br>
• If a player is able to make a capture, there is no option - the jump
must be made. If more than one capture is available, the player is free
to choose whichever he or she prefers.
<br>
<br>
• Back captures made from pieces (non-kings) are not allowed.
<br>
<br>
• When a piece reaches the furthest row from the player who controls
that piece, it is crowned and becomes a king.
<br>
<br>
• Kings are limited to moving diagonally, but may move both forward and
backward. (Remember that single pieces, i.e. non-kings, are always
limited to forward moves.). Kings can move only one square per move.
<br>
<br>
• A player wins the game when the opponent can't make a move. In most
cases, this is because all of the opponent's pieces have been captured,
but it could also be because all of his pieces are blocked in.
<br>
<br>
• The game will draw if both players agree or automatically when at least 50 moves (i.e., 25 moves by each side and remembering that a capture sequence is a single move) without capturing and without king promotion was made by both players.
