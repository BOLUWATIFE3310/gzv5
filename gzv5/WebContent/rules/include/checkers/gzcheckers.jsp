• GZ Checkers is played by two players. Each player begins the game with 12
colored discs. (Typically, one set of pieces is black and the other
red.)
<br>
<br>
• The board consists of 64 squares, alternating between 32 dark and 32
light squares. It is positioned so that each player has a light square
on the right side corner closest to him or her.
<br>
<br>
• Each player places his or her pieces on the 12 dark squares closest to
him or her.
<br>
<br>
• White moves first. Players then alternate moves.
<br>
<br>
• Moves are allowed only on the dark squares, so pieces always move
diagonally. Single pieces are always limited to forward moves (toward
the opponent).
<br>
<br>
• A piece making a non-capturing move (not involving a jump) may move
only one square.
<br>
<br>
• A piece making a capturing move (a jump) leaps over one of the
opponent's pieces, landing in a straight diagonal line on the other
side. Only one piece may be captured in a single jump; however, multiple
jumps are allowed on a single turn.
<br>
<br>
• When a piece is captured, it is removed from the board.
<br>
<br>
• If a player is able to make a capture, there is no option - the jump
must be made. If more than one capture is available, the player is free
to choose whichever he or she prefers.
<br>
<br>
• Back captures made by a piece (non-kings) are allowed only before the first capture. In other words, a piece doesnt start a back capture.
<br>
<br>
• When a piece (non-kings) can make a back capture and there is not forward captures in the same position, the piece can do a forward step avoiding to make the back capture.
<br>
<br>
• When a piece reaches the furthest row from the player who controls
that piece, it is crowned and becomes a king. If the piece become a king during a capturing, the capturing must stop and the turn pass to the opponent.
<br>
<br>
• Kings are limited to moving diagonally, but may move both forward and
backward. (Remember that single pieces, i.e. non-kings, are always
limited to forward moves.). Kings can move only one square per move.
<br>
<br>
• A player wins the game when the opponent can't make a move. In most
cases, this is because all of the opponent's pieces have been captured,
but it could also be because all of his pieces are blocked in.
<br>
<br>
• The game will draw if both players agree or automatically when at least 50 moves (i.e., 25 moves by each side and remembering that a capture sequence is a single move) without capturing and without king promotion was made by both players.
<br>
<br>
• Finally, a player wins the game when the system block is valid. More details about system blocks you can watch in the following video:
