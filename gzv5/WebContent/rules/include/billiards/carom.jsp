As in other carom billiard games, one cushion is played on a pocketless
table with only three balls including two cue balls and one red object ball.
The player has to cause his cue ball to hit one cushion before it hits the second object ball.
The first player who reaches the predetermined score is the winner of the game. 
<br><br>
Here you can be introduced to one cushion billiard rules: 
<br><br>
- On the opening break shot the incoming player's cue ball is placed on the head spot at the table and the red object ball on the foot spot.
<br><br>
- Each time a player scores a legal count, his receives one point and he is entitled to continue shooting at the table.
<br><br>
- In order to complete a legal count, the one cushion player must cause the cue ball to hit one cushion after it hits the first object ball and before it hits the second object ball. 
<br><br>
- The first player who reaches 8 points is the winner of the one cushion billiard game.
